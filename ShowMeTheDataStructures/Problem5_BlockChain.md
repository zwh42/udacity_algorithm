# BlockChain

---

In this problem a double linked list is used to create the chain of block, which is the Block chain. The reason why to use double linked list is that it is very easy to add, remove and traverse the whole chain.

The append time complexity is O(1).
As the block is stored in linked list in the block chain, the space complexity is O(n).
